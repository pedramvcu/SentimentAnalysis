This program will use a training data file to build a model for
sentiment analysis of Tweets. The model is then used to find# the
sentiments of the test data. The model that is learned from
training will be outputted to a file and the resulting analysis
of the test data will be put to console. The program runs as follows from the command line:
python sentiment.py sentiment-train.txt sentiment-test.txt my-model.txt > my-sentiment-answers.txt
